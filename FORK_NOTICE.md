# Maintained Fork Notice

This is a maintained fork of the archived [nativefier/nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier) project.

## Background

The original Nativefier project was archived on September 29, 2023. The maintainers recommended using browser-based shortcuts or Electron directly. However, many users still find value in a maintained CLI tool for creating desktop applications from web apps.

## What's Different

This fork continues development with:

- **Modern Dependencies**: Updated to Electron 39.0.0 (latest stable)
- **Security Updates**: All dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities
- **Active Maintenance**: Regular dependency updates and bug fixes
- **Node 18+ Support**: Updated for modern Node.js versions

## Respect for Original Project

We deeply respect the original maintainers' decision to archive the project. Their recommendation to use browser shortcuts or Electron directly remains valid for many use cases. This fork exists to:

1. Serve users who still need this tool's functionality
2. Maintain security by keeping dependencies updated
3. Preserve the excellent work of the original contributors
